# Open Data Day 2018: Data Science Congressional Data Agenda:

## Pitch
See https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZdlD62xxgczWODtUPHZ3CDPnXnzmuJMkL4FjG3apxSM/edit?usp=sharing (Starting with Slide 29)

## Work
1. Doing Fuzzy Merge between `trg_analytics.candidate_contributions` and `data_ingest.casos__california_candidate_statewide_election_results` which represent Candidate Contribution and Election Results data, respectively.
    1. Trello Ticket: https://trello.com/c/yItjAWEi/31-merge-election-results-and-candidate-contributions-data-together
2. Create additional statistical models to predict election results as a function of candidate contributions. Try both different models and add additional features such as political party affiliation, incumbency status, etc.

    2. Example Python Notebook: https://github.com/sfbrigade/datasci-congressional-data/blob/master/notebooks/ML%20Campaign%20Finance%20and%20Election%20Results%20Example.ipynb
3. Help search for additional datasets. For example, we could use more data on elected officials' voting behaviors (by bill).
