# Goals
In this project, we will build a website to:

1. Introduce the problem we are trying to solve (i.e. some text why campaign finance is so problematic, what solutions did we build, etc.)
2. Display a Dashboard where we will visualize donation data in the state of California
3. Show results from data science model(s) that we build to predict voting behavior based on funding sources.

# Resources
This project will primarily use **design** and  **software engineering** resources.

# Dates
We currently estimate

1. Start Date: 2018-02-07
2. Estimated End Date: 2018-03-21
3. Actual End Date: 

Note that we will likely be updating the website over time as we get more data, build and improve our data science model, etc. The point of this first iteration (initially estimated to complete by February 18th, 2018) is to set up the initial scaffolding, make decisions on what applications we will use, set up the design of the website, and build it in a modular way that future edits can be made fairly easily.

# Background and Significance (why are we doing this?)
The reason why we want to build a website is to better communicate out to the public our results and work.

# Definition of Done
We are done when:

1. We have decided on a technical stack to implement the website. For example, where do we want to host the web server? Do we want to use R Shiny for dashboarding? Are there other applications we want to use (e.g. Google Sites, Wordpress) or do we want to build everything up from scratch?
2. We have a website up and running that people can access publicly. In particular it is **not** sufficient to have it only running locally. 
3. The website has a home page that describes the overall problem clearly and succinctly.
4. There are also other tabs or other sections of the website which at least has placeholders for dashboarding and data science model results.

# External Citations
See [this work](http://tessjeffers.com/) by Tess Jeffers (an Insight Fellow). In this work, demographic characteristics at the zip code level are used to predict campaign contributions (also at the zip code level). There is also an example dashboard of summary statistics one might show.

# Out of Scope
Are there any features and/or analysis that seem potentially interesting but are out of scope for this project? This section may be blank. The purpose of this section is to record anything that might seem related, out of scope for this project, but potentially tackled in a future project.
