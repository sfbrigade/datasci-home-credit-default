#### -- Project Status: [Kicked Off!]

## Project Intro/Objective
Many people struggle to get loans due to insufficient or non-existent credit histories. And, unfortunately, this population is often taken advantage of by untrustworthy lenders.

This project is motivated by the [Home Credit Default Risk](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk) Kaggle Competition. 

### Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling

### Technologies
* Python
* PostgreSQL
* Pandas, Jupyter
* Mode Analytics

### Overview

## Needs of this project

- **Project Manager**: We need project manager who will be in charge of keeping all of us on task and working on highest priority tickets. The Project Manager will set a cadence for how often we need to check in and expectations for timeliness of completion of tasks.
- **Data Processing/Cleaning**: We will need to develop pipelines to parse in data sets provided by Kaggle, join in new datasets, and create data models useful for Machine Learning
- **Statistical Modeling/Machine Learning**: We will need to develop statistical modeling and machine learning models (core of the project!)

## Getting Started
