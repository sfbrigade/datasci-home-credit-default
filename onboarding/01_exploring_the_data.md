# Explore the data
## SQL/Python
Use basic SQL/Python to query and explore the data! We now use [Mode Analytics](https://modeanalytics.com/home/code_for_san_francisco/search) as a frontend tool to query our PostgreSQL database hosted on Microsoft Azure. Ping the #datascience Slack Channel if you need access to Mode.

We've connected Mode Analytics to our PostgreSQL database hosted on Microsoft Azure. Thus, in Mode, you can create a new report and query off of our database, which is called 'data-sci-congressional-data'.

**Note, please only run "read only" queries in Mode. It is not a good idea to run DML/DDL statements that write to the database in Mode since there is no history or record of what is being done**.

In addition, please check our our [Data Scavenger Hunt](../data_scavenger_hunt) which has links to some tutorials and initial questions for you to answer. The purpose of the Data Scavenger Hunt is to acquaint you with our tools, the data, and the project. This is a great place to start with minimal overhead if you are just getting started on the project and want to check it out before committing.

Once you've decided that this is an awesome project with wonderful teammates and want to be a regular contributor (which I'm sure will be an easy decision!) proceed in the onboarding documentation to set up your development environment.
