# What is the Congressional Data project about?

## Context 
The inspiration for this project comes from the [Congressional Data Competition](https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/congressional-data-competition/) sponsored by Challenge.gov. We will specifically focus on Campaign Finance issues both federally and in the state of California.

This folder contains instructions for onboarding onto this project. In addition, please check out the [Data Scavenger Hunt](../data_scavenger_hunt) which is a series of questions to acquaint you with the datasets, learn the tools used in this project, and get you familiar with the structure of the database.

## The details
See the [README.md](../README.md)
