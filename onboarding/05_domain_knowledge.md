# Campaign Finance in California
In California, the Fair Political Practices Commission (FPPC) exists to enforce the Political Reform Act which promotes integrity of state and local government in California through fair, impartial interpretation and enforcement of political campaign, lobbying and conflict of interest laws.

In this doc, we will go through terminology and summarize regulations relevant to this project.

## Terminology

### What is a candidate?
A candidate is any person running for a position in public office. 

### What is a committee?
A committee can be any entity or individual who either receives a non-trivial amount per year for political purposes, makes independent expenditures over a certain amount per year, or makes contributions to California candidates or ballot measures.

There are many different types of committees:

1. Candidate's campaign committee
2. General Purpose Committee
3. A Political Party Committee
4. Slate Mailer Committee
5. A Major Donor
6. Person/entity making independent expenditures on candidates or ballot measures

There are three main ways to qualify as a committee:

1. **Recipient Committee**: Receives contributions of $2,000 or more per year for political purposes. This includes candidate controlled committees; committees primarily formed to support or oppose candidates or ballot measures; political party committees; and other general purpose committees (generally formed to support or oppose more than one candidate or ballot measure).
2. **Independent Expenditure Committee**: Makes independent expenditures of $1,000 or more per year on California candidates or ballot measures. An expenditure is independent if it is not made in consultation, cooperation or coordination with the affected candidate or committee. These committees do not receive contributions.
3. **Major Donor Committee**:** Makes contributions of $10,000 or more per year to or at the request of California candidates or ballot measures. A business, individual, or multi-purpose organization (including a nonprofit organization) may qualify as a major donor committee. These committees do not receive contributions.

This [Getting Started FPPC Manual](http://www.fppc.ca.gov/content/dam/fppc/NS-Documents/TAD/Campaign%20Manuals/Manual_1/Manual-1-Chapter-2-Getting-Started.pdf) is a great resource to learn a bit more on candidates and committees.

Note that candidates manage their funds through their committees -- this will be important as we look to tie political contribution funds back to candidates.

## Regulations
